                 I’ve heard many amazing things about the free agent program, and I’d love to join the program. I feel that I’d be a great fit, and the many free agents I’ve spoken to have suggested I should give it a try. I’m a quick-learner, tech-savvy, and love solving problems. My skills in multimedia, tech, communications, web, social media, management, and team-leading are just some of the things that I think will make me a flexible, valuable addition to the Free Agent Program.

                <p style="font-size: 1.25em">
                  &nbsp;I recently joined the Digital Collaboration Division (previously known as GCtools) as Communications Team Leader. This 4 month opportunity was was a great exercise in action-orientation, courage, passion, problem-solving and team-orientation.</p>
				  <p style="font-size: 1.25em">
                  Upon hiring, I was thrown into many new worlds. One – I was now a team leader. Two – I was doing communications for a totally new job, with no inside knowledge. Three – this was my first time working remotely. And four – sort of (since it’s a combination of two and three above)– I was working remotely AND leading a team at the same time.  Yikes.</p>
				  <p style="font-size: 1.25em">
                  I wasn’t sure if I’d fit in. I’d been a fan of the GCtools for years, but wasn’t sure if my vision and leadership was what the team would need. But I loved the tools, and I jumped in and immersed myself into the culture, the conversations, and the problems. Whether or not people would like my ideas, I was excited to finally be working on a project that I loved and believed in. So I listened to people. I wrote down ideas. I brainstormed with others. I mulled over issues and wrote, wrote, wrote...and came up with a plan to help move us from chaos to an organized chaos. My team believed in my ideas (well, their ideas + mine), and helped me execute them those plans with grace. I have been told that my obvious excitement and energy about the work we were doing made others want to help, and made them believe in the vision. Happiness and excitement are infectious. And I truly love and believe in the GCtools.

                <p style="font-size: 1.25em" id="features">
				Right away, I made sure to integrate myself as much as possible with the other team leaders within the Digital Collaboration Division (GCtools team), and more importantly, with my own team. Following some team meetings with my new team, and meetings with others, I quickly learned some of the successes, challenges, and goals of the team. I immediately started writing a communications plan to help solve both the internal and external problems they faced. Within a week, I started noticing other internal issues and communications gaps, and identified a number of things that I could help with in order to make the teams stronger.</p>
				  <p style="font-size: 1.25em">
				  In short – I was new, things were in chaos (document were all over the place; some in GCcollab, some in GCdocs, some on google drive, others in trello) and we had a lot of deliverables to get done quickly. I immediately drafted an Internal Communications plan and assigned tasks to team members to help consolidate some of the documents that were floating around. I then worked on getting news and updates from the various teams to share with them on an Intranet-style GCcollab group.

                <p style="font-size: 1.25em">
&nbsp;With the Digital Collaboration Division, I made the team my priority. In order to function at our best, we needed to trust each other, be open with each other, and communicate well. I held many team meetings, and met one-on-one with each team member often. I don’t operate under the assumption that my ideas are the best, and I certainly didn’t here either. I dug deep into conversations with the team to find out what they knew about the tools, the problems they saw, and the potential solutions they found. I truly wanted to know what their vision was, and I used their expertise and ideas to build a bigger vision that was the culmination of all of our collective ideas – our Communications plan. It wasn’t my plan, it was ours. If someone shared a great idea, I had no problem celebrating and going with that idea, even if it meant my own idea didn’t get used. Everyone was reflected in that plan, and everyone felt valued. 				                </p>

                &nbsp;In my substantive position at INAC, our region needed a way to share information with all employees. Email was not effective, and people were complaining about getting too many emails. So after a bit of thinking, I proposed (and designed) an entire intranet that is still being used 10 years later.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25em">
                The first version of the intranet used software that was supplied by the INAC I.T. department. About 3 years later, our Headquarters brought in a new software that could be used to manage the Intranet, and every INAC region was planning to migrate to this new software for managing the Intranet. However, I quickly noticed that it was going to be harder to use, slower, and more expensive. Around the same time,  I had discovered GCpedia, and quickly designed a briefing and presentation to Senior Management to try and convince them to let me build a new Intranet on Gcpedia. After all, I knew what outcome people wanted, and I knew there was a better, cheaper way to do it.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25em">
                I briefed regional Senior Management on GCpedia vs. The Headquarters Intranet solution, and they agreed that my plan was better, and gave me permission to build the new Intranet on GCpedia, despite the fact that all other regions were going with the software solution from our Headquarters.  I rebuilt the intranet on GCpedia with the intent of making it easier to access, easier for others to update, and with the added bonus (or was it a sneaky idea?) of having our employees visit GCpedia every day, thereby getting them used to this “new” (at the time) tool. Today there isn’t a single employee in the region who doesn’t have access to all the regional news, and there also isn’t a single employee who doesn’t know what GCpedia is. Oh, and shortly after my presentation to Senior Management, I had several other regions Senior Management ask me for a presentation, and lo and behold, they also switched to GCpedia for their Intranet.

At INAC, I once had an unexpected call from a member of the public. It was a young lady, with an unusual request. Her mother had passed away unexpectedly, and the service was happening in less than a week. She was aware of a photo that had been taken of her and her mother for an INAC promotional campaign many, many years ago, and was wondering if we could somehow get the photo to her for the service. I could immediately feel the heartbreak in her voice, and promised I would do my best.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25em">
                I immediately searched our local records, and couldn’t find the photo, but found records that had names of previous employees who had worked on the project. I quickly got on facebook and messaged these ex-employees to see what they knew. I got conflicting information, but ended up with the names of several photographers that might have done the shoot.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25em">
                As a professional photographer, I know all of the other professional photographers in our small town of Whitehorse, so I messaged them on Facebook, and within a few hours I heard back from the photographer who had done the photoshoot. He told me he would search his archives to try and find the photos. He did. And he sent them to the family for free. A few weeks later I got a phone call and a thank you card from the family. It wasn’t part of my job description, but I knew it was extremely important to them, and knew that if I was in the same situation, I’d be forever grateful to have someone do the same for me.

Have you ever heard of the CttechTour? Maybe. Maybe not. It was a grand idea of a colleague of mine to do a cross country tour to teach federal government employees how to use computers and software better. As soon as I heard of it, I reached out, and was accepted as part of the team. We build partners, secured locations, worked out financial details, and had a launch campaign ready to roll out. Then, at the last minute, the tour was cancelled as a result of some last-minute, unexpected decisions by my colleague’s management team. We had worked for months to get everything in place, and we were devastated by the outcome.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25em">
             
				My colleague, the leader of the project, never did get the opportunity to bring back the tour, despite the fact that we had been so close to making it happen.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25em">
             
				After a week of reflecting on what had happened, I realized the reasons I had gotten involved in the first place:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p style="font-size: 1.25em" class="auto-style2">&nbsp;I wanted to help people</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p style="font-size: 1.25em" class="auto-style2">&nbsp;I’m a techy kind of guy. And this was right up my alley</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p style="font-size: 1.25em" class="auto-style2">&nbsp;It let me work on things I liked. Web pages, software, communications.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p style="font-size: 1.25em" class="auto-style2">&nbsp;It gave me a chance to work with other people from different departments. 
    				</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p style="font-size: 1.25em" class="auto-style2">It was a need – one that I knew we had the abilities to fulfill.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="font-size: 1.25em">
             
				Within a few weeks I was back to expanding my work boundaries. I was working on the GCtools with the GCtools teams, contributing to Federal Government hackathons, and reaching out and helping with Open Government Projects. We may have failed with the TechTour, but the feelings that inspired me to do it in the first place were still there, and there were many places I could reach out to contribute my ideas, my expertise, and my desire to help others.

				<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.25em">I think I might have already summed it up. I love to help others. I love to solve problems. I love a challenge, and I’ve got a combination of experience, tech-skills, management skills, and passion that usually lets me find a solution to any problem. I can’t say that I always find the best solution, but much like self-actualization, I believe we’re always on a road to improvement.  And with each new, crazy, fun, unique project I find to work on, my solutions get better, and I become a better person. </p>
<p style="font-size: 1.25em">And this is why I’d love to be part of the Free Agents Program. 		</p>
